      <h3>hooks</h3>
      <p> Jigs are good for active fishing, but hooks with bait are for if you are going to do something else.</p>
      <p>Look at what's around. That's usually what the bigger fish eat.</p>
      <h3>rods and reels</h3>
      <p>Make sure to use the right one! Usually, you want a rod that can bear at least twice the weight of the fish you are catching.</p>
      <h3>fishing line</h3>
      <p>Picking this is the tricky part. This depends on what type of person you are and what you are fishign for. </p>
